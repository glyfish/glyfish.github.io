A [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) is a sequence of states
where transitions between states occur ordered in time with
the probability of a transition depending only on the previous state. Here the
states will be assumed a continuous unbounded set set and time a discrete unbounded set.

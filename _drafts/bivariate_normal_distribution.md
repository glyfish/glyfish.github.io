The [Bivariate Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) is obtained by
application of a linear transformation to a sum of independent {% katex %}\textbf{Normal}(0, 1){% endkatex %}
random variables. It is frequently used because it is one of the simplest distributions providing a model of correlation between random variables.
